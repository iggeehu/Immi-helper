# Immigence: Your USCIS Insights
- A tool for new immigrants/non-immigrant petitioners to compare their case in their case range.
- Cases are divided into ranges of 5000. Daily crawlers work around the clock to scan for approvals/trends.
- Data visualization tools help gauge approval rate and approval trends.

## How to use

1. Type in your case information.  
   If someone in your range has queried before, you will be redirected to the range details page.
